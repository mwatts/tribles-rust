/// A value is accepted if *any* variant accepts it. Built by the

/// or directly via [`new`](Self::new).
///
/// All variants must declare the same [`VariableSet`]; this is asserted at
/// construction time. Branch-local variables are unsupported because the
/// engine's result schema is flat — every row binds the same variable set
/// exactly once, so a variable that exists only in some alternatives has
/// no representation. (This is a result-model restriction, not a semantic
/// one: the union itself is monotonic.) Since `pattern!` folds attribute
/// constants and literal values into constant [`Term`](crate::query::Term)s
/// (they never become variables), the requirement is about the *query
/// variables the caller wrote*: every arm must mention the same ones.
/// Estimates are summed across variants, proposals are merged and
/// deduplicated, and confirmations are ORed per candidate region.
///
/// Before proposing or confirming, the union checks each variant's
/// [`satisfied`](Constraint::satisfied) status for the row and skips
/// variants that are provably dead. This is not a leftover of the old
/// hidden-variable desugar — folding literals into constant `Term`s did
/// not retire it, because deadness does not come from the constants. It
/// comes from a variant being a *conjunction*: `pattern!` lowers to an
/// [`IntersectionConstraint`](crate::query::intersectionconstraint::IntersectionConstraint) with
/// one clause per triple, and a propose/confirm pass consults only the
/// clauses that return `Some` from `estimate` for the variable at hand.
/// So in an arm like `{ ?p @ nickname: "Ali", city: ?out }` the `nickname`
/// clause takes no part in the `?out` pass at all. Once `?p` is bound to
/// an entity whose nickname is not `"Ali"` that arm is logically dead, yet
/// its `city` clause would still propose the entity's city — and since the
/// union ORs the per-variant survivors, the arm then confirms its own
/// proposal and the row escapes. The liveness gate is what notices: the
/// pinned clause's own `satisfied` is `false`, the intersection conjoins
/// that to kill the arm, and the union drops the arm's contribution for
/// that row. Both call sites are independently load-bearing; the
/// `union_dead_variant_leak` integration test pins one leak per site.
