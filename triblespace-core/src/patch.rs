//! Two [`PATCH`](crate::patch::PATCH)es are considered equal if they contain the same set of keys,

/// A PATCH is a persistent data structure that stores a set of keys.
/// Each key can be reordered and segmented, based on the provided key ordering and segmentation.
///
/// The patch supports efficient set operations, like union, intersection, and difference,
/// because it efficiently maintains a hash for all keys that are part of a sub-tree.
///
/// The tree itself is a path- and node-compressed a 256-ary trie.
/// Each nodes stores its children in a byte oriented cuckoo hash table,
/// allowing for O(1) access to children, while keeping the memory overhead low.
/// Table sizes are powers of two, starting at 2.
///
/// Having a single node type for all branching factors simplifies the implementation,
/// compared to other adaptive trie implementations, like ARTs or Judy Arrays
///
/// The PATCH allows for cheap copy-on-write operations, with `clone` being O(1).
/// Its persistent snapshots can share leaves, so a PATCH is `Send + Sync` only
/// when its associated value is also both `Send` and `Sync`.
///
/// A value that is neither thread-safe cannot make a PATCH thread-safe:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use std::rc::Rc;
/// use triblespace_core::patch::{IdentitySchema, PATCH};
///
/// fn assert_send_sync<T: Send + Sync>() {}
/// assert_send_sync::<PATCH<1, IdentitySchema, Rc<()>>>();
/// ```
///
/// `Cell<u64>` is `Send` but not `Sync`. Rejecting this case is important:
/// moving one PATCH snapshot can leave another snapshot reading the same leaf
/// on its original thread.
///
/// ```compile_fail
