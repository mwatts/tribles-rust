Tribles is a knowledge graph standard for blob storage.

We hope to overcome the shortcomings of existing semantic web technologies, through simplicity, easy canonicalization, clean distributed semantics and lightweight libraries that leverage language capabilities.

By reifying most concepts and operations as first class citizens, we hope to provide a set of tools that can be flexibly combined to serve a variety of knowledge representation, database, and data exchange use cases.
