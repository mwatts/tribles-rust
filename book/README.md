# Tribles Book

This directory contains a work-in-progress guide built with
[`mdBook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). If you don't have
`mdbook` installed yet, run `cargo install mdbook`. To build the HTML
locally, run:

```bash
./scripts/build_book.sh
```

The rendered book will appear under `target/book`.
