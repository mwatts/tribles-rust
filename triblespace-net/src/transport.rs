//! The transport seam — everything the sync protocol needs from a
//! network, as traits.
//!
//! This module exists so the *entire* protocol stack above it — the
//! host loop, CONNECT/SYNC_TEAM authorization, Merkle inventory reads, and
//! DHT provider operations — can run
//! unmodified against either:
//!
//! - [`crate::transport::iroh`]: the production iroh QUIC adapter, or
//! - a deterministic in-memory simulator (discrete-event router with
//!   seeded delays, partitions, and crashes) for
//!   FoundationDB/TigerBeetle-style simulation testing.
//!
//! Design rule: the seam carries network capabilities, not protocol. Anything
//! that decides what bytes mean (ALPN dispatch targets, frame layouts,
//! auth semantics, scope checks) lives above; anything that decides how
//! bytes move (QUIC, relays, and NAT traversal) lives below.
//! The week-of-2026-06-04 bug hunt found every
//! protocol bug *above* this line (snapshot ordering and authentication
//! subject binding), which is why the
//! host loop must run inside the simulator rather than being mocked
//! out at the `NetCommand`/`NetEvent` channel boundary.
//!
//! Stream IO is plain `tokio::io::{AsyncRead, AsyncWrite}` — iroh's
//! QUIC streams already implement both, and an in-memory duplex pipe
//! trivially does. `SendStream::finish()` maps to
//! `AsyncWriteExt::shutdown()`.
